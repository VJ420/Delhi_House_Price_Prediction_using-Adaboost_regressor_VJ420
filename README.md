# Delhi_House_Price_Prediction_using-Adaboost_regressor_VJ420
Delhi is a vibrant and rapidly growing city, and the demand for housing has been increasing in recent years. 
To help potential buyers and sellers understand the current market conditions,I have developed a house price predictor model using the AdaBoost regressor algorithm.
The model is trained on a large dataset containing information about various properties in Delhi, like Area ,size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms
and other relevant features. 
The AdaBoost regressor algorithm is used to learn the relationship between these features and the corresponding house prices, 
and to make predictions about the likely price of a given property.
